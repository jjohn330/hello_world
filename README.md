# hello_world

Hello, my name is Justin Johnson. I attend the University of Tennessee, and I am studying statistics and computer science. To date, I have experience coding in some OOP languages such as C++, imperative languages like C, and familiarity with databasing and statistical computing. My GitHub coding repositories will feature projects covering computational statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering. I hope you enjoy!
